      "2  It is well established that some infections can be severe, particularly in older adults with underlying medical conditions  , but based on the generally mild clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV cases detected outside China, it appears that there could be many more mild infections than severe infections.\n",
      "3  From intermittent animal-to-human spill-over events, the MERS-CoV spreads sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older adults, especially males, with pre-existing diseases.\n",

      "7  Consistent with recent reports, our results suggest that 2019-nCoV is more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these patients  , and 2019-nCoV-associated death is also related to elder age and underlying illnesses, especially hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease.\n",
      "8  Up to now, no evidence suggested that pregnant women need caesarean section merely because of SARS-CoV-2 positive in mother's throat swab 16 .\n",
      "9  Given the current lack of data of the potential and outcome of pregnancy infected by the SARS-CoV2, we use the promising scRNA-seq data to evaluate the expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface and different organs to give a better perspective of transmission potential of the virus to the fetus on the cellular level.\n",

      "12  Distribution of MERS-CoV sero-positive samples was not found to be associated with sex, age, birthplace, migration or pregnancy of camels but may be associated with the breed  .\n",
      "13  MERS-CoV infection of women during pregnancy has adverse outcomes, with fetal mortality of~27%; however, only a limited number of pediatric MERS-CoV infections occur     .\n",

      "16  Martha Anker, an expert in statistics formerly with the WHO and the University of Massachusetts, estimated that more than 100 cases of SARS-CoV infection occurred in pregnant women, which warrants closer inspection  .\n",
      "17   reported 7 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV who were followed at a designated SARS unit-2 of the 7 died , and 4  required ICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation.\n",
      "18  In contrast, the mortality rate was less than 10% and mechanical ventilation rate less than 20% among non-pregnant, age-matched counterparts who were not infected with SARS-CoV.\n",
      "19 Fortunately, there were no cases of vertical transmission identified among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV during the 2002-2003 Asian epidemic  , and with the exception of a small cluster of cases that recurred in late 2003, no new cases of SARS have occurred.\n",
      "20   reported the findings from 7 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV.\n",
      "21  In the case of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, the placentas were found to be normal.\n",
      "22  Three placentas were delivered from pregnancies in which the mothers had acute SARS-CoV infection-these were abnormal and demonstrated increased subchorionic and intervillous fibrin, a finding that can be associated with abnormal maternal blood flow to the placenta.\n",
      "23  In the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy the placentas were highly abnormal.\n",
      "24  Pregnant women may develop severe disease and fatal maternal and/or fetal outcomes as a result of MERS-CoV infection; however, little is known of the pathophysiology of this infection during pregnancy.\n",

      "26  Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus, appear to have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that MERS-CoV could also lead to severe clinical outcomes in pregnancy.\n",
      "27  These instances of severe maternal and perinatal outcomes are consistent with other reports of MERS-CoV infection in pregnant women, as well as outcomes associated with SARS-CoV infection.\n",
      "28  They conclude that pregnancy testing for women of reproductive age should be considered for those who test positive for MERS-CoV, to contribute to overall understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiological risk.\n",
      "29 It is vitally important that pregnant women be considered in the design, clinical trial, and implementation of vaccine candidates for 2019-nCoV.\n",
      "30 A critical question that must be answered at this stage-with a clear view of the potential deleterious effects of a new coronavirus in pregnancy-is will maternal immunization be a priority in research and development? As of the PHEIC declaration, 12 groups have announced that they are developing new vaccines against 2019-nCoV and seven others announced initiatives to develop new therapies  .\n",
      "31  It remains to be seen during the current Wuhan 2019-nCoV epidemic how this newly-emergent coronavirus affects pregnant women and their infants, as well as which factors may modulate obstetrical disease and outcomes including the timing of maternal coronavirus exposure by gestational age, the effects of medications or other treatment regimens, differences in host immune responses, occurrence of coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions, and other covariables.\n",
      "32  However, pregnant women should be considered to be at high risk for developing severe infection during this current outbreak of 2019-nCoV.\n",
      "33  Additional clinical research on the treatment of SARS, MERS, and the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV is necessary if we are to understand the potential risks and benefits of novel therapies and new vaccines in pregnancy.\n",

      "36  We report the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman who acquired the infection during the last trimester of pregnancy during a large hospital outbreak.\n",
      "37 In the present report, we have described a serious case of MERS-CoV during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, requiring mechanical ventilation.\n",
      "38  Various factors may have contributed to this, including the timing of MERS-CoV exposure during pregnancy, her young age, the use of steroids, and potential differences in immune responses.\n",
      "39 There is limited information available on pregnancy, during antenatal, birth, or postnatal period, and MERS-CoV infection.\n",
      "40  Drug treatment of MERS-CoV in pregnancy requires further investigation in the clinical setting.\n",
      "41 This report provides an initial view of the outcome associated with pregnancy-related MERS CoV infection.\n",
      "42  A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother did subsequently develop antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection  .\n",
      "43  We experienced a case of a Korean pregnant woman who was confirmed for a MERS-CoV infection via a polymerase chain reaction  test.\n",
      "44  However, there are limited data about the clinical features of MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy and the perinatal outcome of patients diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection.\n",
      "45  To our best knowledge, there have been 9 reported cases in which pregnant patients had positive laboratory results for MERS-CoV including this case      .\n",
      "46  Unlike other cases, this case is not only the first MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy occurred outside of the Middle East, but also the first case of MERS confirmed on 3rd trimester of pregnancy showing good outcome of both mother and baby.\n",
      "47  However, there is limited knowledge about the clinical implications of MERS-CoV infection on the maternal, fetal, and placental aspects of pregnancy.\n",
      "48  Also, it is unknown whether MERS-CoV infected pregnant women have a more severe disease course compared with the non-pregnant population.\n",
      "49  To know whether prenatal transmission of MERS-CoV can occur, collection of samples including amniotic fluid, placenta, and umbilical cord is needed from an infected pregnant patient.\n",
      "50 In the three documented cases of pregnant women with MERS-CoV infection, one woman in her second trimester of pregnancy  experienced a stillbirth; the mother survived ).\n",
      "51  We searched MEDLINE and PubMed for the keywords Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, MERS-CoV, in combination with pediatric, children, childhood, infancy and pregnancy from the initial discovery of the virus in June 2012 until April 19, 2016.\n",
      "52 Little data also exist regarding the effect and the likelihood of MERS-CoV in pregnancy.\n",
      "53  The exact prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies and exposure of pregnant women to MERS-CoV is not known.\n",
      "54 Pregnant women are conventionally considered a high-risk group for the progression to severe disease or death, and a case was reported of stillbirth in the second trimester of pregnancy for a woman infected with MERS-CoV  .\n",
      "55  The remaining six patients were admitted for septic arthritis, abdominal pain and dysuria, black discoloration of toes, bleeding during pregnancy, and hyponatremia, which are not typically associated with the MERS-CoV infection.\n",
      "56 A pregnant woman infected with MERS-CoV in her 35 weeks of gestational age developed dyspnea and her chest radiograph showed diffuse infiltrates in the left lower lung zone.\n",
      "57 All serum samples from the 10 pregnant women and the two IVIG products were negative for IgG antibody  to SARS-CoV.\n",
      "58  Furthermore, several issues are relevant to MERS-CoV and other infectious diseases acquired during pregnancy: 1) pregnancy is associated with immunologic changes that may alter susceptibility to and severity of infectious diseases; 2) the effects of infection upon the fetus are not fully understood; and 3) prophylaxis and treatment appropriate for the general population might not be appropriate for pregnant women     .\n",
      "59 Although, MERS-CoV infection and pregnancy were a fatal combination for the patient in our study, virus shedding ceased in the patient during therapy with ribavirin and peginterferon-a.\n",
      "60  The potential role of cyclosporine, intravenous immune globulin, and high-frequency ventilation for treatment of MERS-CoV during pregnancy needs evaluation.\n",
      "61  MERS-CoV infection and pregnancy were a fatal combination in this case.\n",
      "62  Thus, this regimen needs to be further studied in pregnant patients with MERS-CoV infection.\n",
      "63  Patient 1 had a pregnant daughter who was a frequent visitor during her hospitalization but who tested negative for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n",
      "64  Data are limited regarding the effect of SARS-CoV on human pregnancy  .\n",
      "65  We report additional details on the clinical course and outcomes of a case of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman  .\n",
      "66  The presence, in this case, of SARS-CoV antibodies in cord blood and breast milk raises the issue of whether SARS-CoV infection during pregnancy results in passive immunity.\n",
      "67  Serial serologic testing of newborn clinical specimens and breast milk may provide a better understanding of the natural history of the fetal and newborn immune response to SARS-CoV infection during pregnancy.\n",
      "68 This report, in conjunction with the reports from Hong Kong  , provides an initial view of the spectrum of illness and outcomes associated with pregnancy-related SARS-CoV infection.\n",
      "69  Data on larger numbers of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV may help refine infectioncontrol strategies and provide a sound basis for clinical guidelines to manage future cases.\n",
      "70  Four of the 9 patients were women; 2 of them, patients 2 and 8, were 32 weeks and 20 weeks' pregnant, respectively, when they had MERS-CoV infection.\n",
      "71 Although other countries have reported cases of severe illness and poor outcome associated with SARS-CoV infection during pregnancy    , neither of the two pregnant SARS case-patients in the United States had serious adverse outcomes.\n",
      "72  However, too few cases have been studied to clearly define the risks and provide guidance for treating pregnant women infected with SARS CoV.\n",
      "73  This may apply particularly to patients with pre-existing lung disease, where respiratory viral illness, caused by SARS-CoV-2 or otherwise, may trigger clinical deterioration that could ordinarily be managed by early community intervention.\n",
      "74  Previous studies suggest that patients with diabetes, chronic lung diseases, renal failure, or immunocompromised are prone to greater risk of severe coronavirus onsets, however, there is little evidence to suggest that such underlying comorbidities contributed to disproportionate infection of MERS-CoV  .\n",

      "644  51 The transduced mouse developed pneumonia when infected with MERS-CoV.\n",
      "645  Collectively, these results demonstrated that AM580 effectively protected hDPP4transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge by inhibiting MERS-CoV replication and virus-associated pneumonia and encephalitis in vivo.\n",

      "651  Fever, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome with a history of travel to the Arab Peninsula are some of the symptoms that are used to diagnose a MERS-CoV infection.\n",
      "652  For example, in 2003, researchers on three continents who studied known respiratory pathogens were able to identify the first member of the coronavirus family causing widespread pneumonia in humans, the SARS-CoV     .\n",
      "653  MERS-CoV was first described in 2012 and was isolated from a 60-year old man with acute pneumonia, renal failure and fatal outcome in Saudi Arabia  .\n",
      "654  In distinct contrast to the mild human coronaviruses HCoV-229E  , HCoV-OC43  , HCoV-NL63  , and HCoV-HKU1  , infection with SARS-CoV frequently resulted in severe symptoms including fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia.\n",
      "655  Furthermore, initial chest radiographs did not show clear signs of interstitial pneumonia as expected with MERS-CoV infection.\n",
      "656  In 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from clinical species of infants suffering from pneumonia or bronchiolitis, and characterized for its ability to infect human respiratory tract  .\n",
      "657  The subsequent study in 2005 identified a new member of CoVs, named HCoV-HKU1, from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia  .\n",

      "660 MERS-CoV is more prevalent in males  and has a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, which includes acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, myocarditis and organ failure  .\n",
      "661  While not yet confirmed to induce the viral pneumonia, 2019-nCoV was quickly predicted as the likely causative agent.\n",
      "662  Most HCoV-HKU1 infections are self-limiting, with only two deaths reported in patients with HCoV-HKU1 pneumonia  .\n",
      "663  Furthermore, in our retrospective study of patients with community acquired pneumonia, all the six patients with serum samples available showed four-fold changes in IgG titer and/or presence of IgM against HCoV-HKU1  .\n",
      "664  The common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV developed moderate to severe acute pneumonia and increased viral load in the respiratory tract in addition to other clinical symptoms experienced by rhesus macaques  .\n",
      "665  Mice transduced by a viral vector to express human DPP4  were shown to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, manifested by the development of pneumonia and histopathological changes in the lungs.\n",

      "668 On 9 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, was officially identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan.\n",
      "669  While the case definition for laboratory-confirmed cases has not been officially published, our understanding is that the initial case definition required  fever,  x-ray evidence of pneumonia,  white blood cell count normal or low or low lymphocyte count,  antibiotic treatment for 3 days without improvement, in addition to  one or more recent visits to Wuhan or direct or indirect exposure to a wet market in Wuhan, and  a respiratory specimen positive for 2019-nCoV and confirmed as 2019-nCoV by whole genome sequencing.\n",
      "670  In humans, SARS-CoV infection progresses from an atypical pneumonia to acute diffuse alveolar damage and ARDS  .\n",

      "672  reported that the rSbased IgM ELISA is more sensitive than the rN-based IgM ELISA for SARS-CoV pneumonia  .\n",
      "673 None of those with MERS-CoV antibodies had a history of severe pneumonia, a common feature of severe MERS  .\n",
      "674  It is known that MERS-CoV infection may range from being asymptomatic to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome  and death, and that some mild or asymptomatic infections may contribute to onward transmission  .\n",
      "675  This is not unexpected as even patients with confirmed MERS-CoV disease do not invariably mount robust neutralising or ELISA antibody titres unless they have severe pneumonia  .\n",
      "676  Also MERS-CoV, which causes pneumonia and respiratory failure, has been demonstrated to induce profound cell death within 24 h of infection, irrespective of viral titers produced by the infected cells.\n",
      "677  MERS-CoV infection often causes fever, cough, and severe pneumonia, occasionally accompanied by renal disease  .\n",
      "678  These include coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU1, which are responsible for common cold and upper respiratory diseases, as well as SARS-CoV, which causes life-threatening pneumonia.\n",
      "679  In contrast, SARS-CoV infection caused severe disease in the lower respiratory tract disease with symptoms ranging from flu-like and viral pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome  and fatal outcome     .\n",
      "680  More recently, formalin-inactivated whole-virus  and adenovirus-based  SARS-CoV vaccine candidates have shown promise in reducing pneumonia during SARS-CoV challenge in ferrets.\n",
      "681 Pathological findings in the rhesus macaque tissues HE stained tissues from rhesus macaques experimentally infected with MERS-CoV demonstrate that MERS-CoV induces lesions that are primarily observed in the lungs, with varying degrees of inflammation, interstitial pneumonia  , pulmonary oedema  , haemorrhaging, degeneration and necrosis of pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells  , and the infiltration of inflammatory cells.\n",
      "682  Previous studies on rhesus macaques have shown that histological lesions induced by MERS-CoV infection were limited to the lungs, which exhibited interstitial pneumonia with a thickening of alveolar septa caused by oedema and fibrin accumulation, and small to moderate numbers of macrophages and even fewer neutrophils.\n",
      "683  Fatal human cases of MERS-CoV infection cause upper respiratory tract illness, severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure.\n",
      "684  Rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV display pneumonia, reduced appetite, significant lung pathology, and inflammatory infiltrates  .\n",
      "685  In 2005, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from patients with pneumonia and was defined as a new group of HCoV, featuring the lowest G + C content  among all coronaviruses with a known genome sequence  .\n",
      "686 The specificity of the multiplex RT-PCR assay was evaluated by detecting pediatric pneumonia specimens that were positive for other pathogens, including RSV, HAdV, HMPV, HPIV, EV/Rh, HCoV, and HBoV  using a Luminex RVP assay.\n",
      "687  Another important human CoV is NL63, which causes croup in children and is associated with pneumonia in the elderly  .\n",
      "688  Importantly, this included CoV of different genera including the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome -CoV, a paradigmatic emerging virus that entails considerable pandemic risks due to its prevalence in dromedary populations in Africa and the Arabian Pensinsula and its transmission via the respiratory tract causing a severe form of pneumonia in humans     .\n",
      "689  In severe cases, these four HCoVs can cause life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis especially in elderly, children and immunocompromised patients  .\n",
      "690 SARS-CoV first emerged in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China as an atypical pneumonia marked by fever, headache and subsequent onset of respiratory symptoms such as cough and pneumonia, which may later develop into life-threatening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome  .\n",
      "691  We found that RSV  and PIVs  infection were more likely to be associated with pneumonia than were ADV  and HCoV , while IVB shared the same chance to develop pneumonia and bronchitis .\n",
      "692  Two highly pathogenic hCoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus , which were identified in the OPEN ACCESS Middle East and Europe in 2012, and the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus , which emerged in China in 2002-2003, causes severe acute pneumonia and respiratory failure, with 10% and 36%  fatality rates, respectively       .\n",
      "693  In humans, CoVs were recognized as typically causing colds and pneumonia until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  in 2012 from zoonotic sources  .\n",
      "694  However, in 2002-2003 the outbreak of a novel HCoV in China, causing severe fatal atypical pneumonia in infected individuals, demonstrated that HCoVs are also able to induce severe life-threatening disease in humans.\n",
      "695  It gives incomplete protection in MERS-CoV-challenged NHPs, with the alleviation of pneumonia and clinical manifestations, as well as the reduction of viral load in lung, trachea, and oropharyngeal swabs  .\n",
      "696  In recent years, several coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have caused severe pneumonia among humans  .\n",
      "697  Similarly, the MERS-CoV strain causes lethal pneumonia, and here it is significant that antibodies specific for the MERS-CoV S1A domains both neutralize the virus and reduce infection and pathogenesis in a mouse MERS-CoV model system  .\n",
      "698  We recently demonstrated the presence of hMPV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HBoV, WUV, and KIV in patients with influenza-like illness in the Philippines  , but were unable to assess their clinical significance in children with pneumonia.\n",

      "703  Clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection include fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue with pneumonia demonstrated on chest CT scan imaging 6 .\n",
      "704 An additional advantage of using ACE2 as a 2019-nCoV S protein neutralizing agent is that ACE2 administration could also directly treat the pneumonia pathophysiology.\n",
      "705  A portion of patients with SARS and 2019-nCoV infection develop pneumonia, which is characterized by pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome  1,2 .\n",
      "706  In 2012, the KSA reported a case of fatal pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV infection  .\n",
      "707 In 2005 the fifth human coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, was discovered by RT-PCR screening with conserved coronavirus primers on respiratory samples from adult patients with pneumonia that were negative for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus   .\n",
      "708  In parallel to these advances, and as an alternative approach to study HCoV-HKU1, we reasoned that HCoV-HKU1, like SARS-CoV  , may be able to infect and be serially propagated in human alveolar cells since this virus is known to cause pneumonia in a subset of patients.\n",
      "709 Transnasal infection with MERS-CoV following adenoviral transduction of human DPP4 yielded an expansive,  interstitial pneumonia with severe alveolar epithelial cell necrosis and infiltration of mainly macrophages, lymphocytes, and fewer neutrophils  .\n",
      "710  Since then, CoVs surveillance programs were intensified, and two additional human coronaviruses, already circulating in the human population, were identified as the causative agents of several cases of pneumonia and bronchiolitis   .\n",

      "894 It is plausible that a higher infective dose of MERS-CoV can lead to a shorter incubation period and more severe pneumonia.\n",
      "895  These results suggest that severe pneumonia is possibly a result of host immune response to MERS-CoV, rather than the virus infection per se, as in severe acute respiratory syndrome  .\n",
      "896  Indeed, a recent autopsy study showed that the pathologic basis for MERS-CoV pneumonia was pulmonary edema, type 2 pneumocytes hyperplasia, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial pneumonia with lymphocytic infiltration and syncytium formation  .\n",

      "1126 Obviously, increased amounts of cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , are associated with severe lung injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n",
      "1127  In addition, the serum level of serial cytokines of IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α in SARS-CoV-2 infected HD patients remain relatively lower in comparison with non-HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
      "1128  In this regard, we have recently shown that IL-6 and/or IL-8 released by SARS-CoVinfected human bronchoepithelial Calu-3 cells could exacerbate host innate inflammatory responses, in part, by modulating the intrinsic functions of macrophages  and dendritic cells   .\n",
      "1129  As shown in Figure 6A -B, genes encoding CCL20, IL-1A, IL-6, and IL-8 appeared to be among the first batch of inflammatory genes activated by SARS-CoV at 24 hrs.\n",
      "1130 The discordant mRNA and protein expression of genes encoding for FGF basic, PDGF BB, and, IL-1RA in SARS-CoV-infected 2B4 cells prompted us to evaluate the correlativity of mRNA and the corresponding protein expression among a cohort of virally activated genes, including CCL5/RANTES, CXCL1/ GROa, CXCL10/IP-10, IFN-b, IFN-l1,IFN-l2, IL-1a, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFSF10/TRAIL.\n",

      "1134  It was demonstrated that the proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-6 exhibited a delayed but marked induction upon MERS-CoV infection  .\n",
      "1135  Among the several investigated inflammatory cytokines, the IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were increased in MRC-5 cells by HCoV-OC43 infection, but were relatively low in compound-treated virus-infected MRC-5 cells as compared with the virus-infected group without compound treatment .\n",
      "1136  The two innate immune gene clusters, IL-6 signaling/complement and IRG cluster, were strongly expressed in ferret lung tissue from 2-14 DPI with SARS-CoV relative to the mock primary infection group.\n",
      "1137  Early  expression of IL-6 signaling/ complement and IFN response genes followed immediately  by antigen processing and presentation gene expression correlated with peak SARS-CoV titres in the lungs and peak neutralizing antibody titers, respectively.\n",

      "1139  Since IL-6 signaling can drive further IL-6 expression via the RAS/MAP kinase cascade and NF-IL6 activation  our results suggest that potentially self-sustaining acute phase responses occur during early SARS-CoV infection and not after reinfection.\n",
      "1140  This is the case for SARS CoV mRNAs, which are protected from nsp1-mediated degradation  or for the host IL-6 mRNA during KSHV infection, which is protected from SOX-mediated degradation through 3' UTR elements  .\n",
      "1141  As shown in the Figure 4C -E, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 showed increased levels in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of piglets inoculated with PDCoV, rPDCoV, rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP and rPDCoV-ΔNS7 compared to mock-inoculated group.\n",
      "1142  Moreover, the mRNA levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in the intestinal tissues obtained from rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP-infected piglets were significantly decreased compared to the wild-type PDCoV group, while there were no significant differences in IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 expression detected in duodenums, jejunum and ileums among rPDCoV-ΔNS7-, rPDCoV-and PDCoV-inoculated groups  .\n",
      "1143  As shown in Figure 1 , ssRNA stimulation of human leukocytes induced cytokines/chemokines similar to those observed in murine SARS-CoV pneumonitis including IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF, CXCL8 , CCL2 , CCL3 , and CCL4 .\n",
      "1144  At 72 hours post inoculation, HCoV-HKU1 infection induced markedly increased levels of mRNAs encoding type III interferons , interferon-responsive genes , proinflammatory chemokines , and IL-6.\n",

      "1146  5 , IL-6 is induced only weakly by SARS-CoV, independent of the cell line used  .\n",
      "1147 Thus, SARS-CoV strongly induces IL-8, but not IL-6 in a cell-type dependent manner.\n",
      "1148 Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV does not induce significant amounts of IFNs, antiviral genes, RANTES, and IL-6.\n",
      "1149  Because the only difference between SARS CoV VLPs and BVLPs lies in the S protein, the difference in IL-6 and TNF-a induction is highly likely due to the variation between the two S proteins.\n",
      "1150  Of interest, in the current study, BVLPs induced much higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-a than did SARS CoV VLPs.\n",
      "1151  Therefore, to assess the inflammatory responses in mice, we measured TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 in serum at Day 3 post-MERS-CoV infection.\n",

      "1155 To address whether MERS-CoV accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b or 5 interfere with the innate immune response during infection, we infected Huh-7 cells with previously engineered MERS-CoV deletion mutants   and analyzed the expression of interferon β  and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α.\n",
      "1156  While deletion of 4a did not have any effect on the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α as compared to the wild-type virus, deletion of 4b significantly increased their expression to similar or even higher levels than those observed in MERS-CoV-Δ4ab, indicating that the 4b protein contributed to the repression of NF-κBdependent gene expression.\n",
      "1157  Previously, it was shown that ARDS caused by SARS-CoV infection is associated with the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and TNF-α , many of which were highly expressed in the lungs of SARS patients 30 .\n",

      "1163  Our studies indicate that protection from SARS-CoV infection correlates with MyD88-dependent induction of IL1-b, TNF-a, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1a, and RANTES at early times post infection and many of these cytokines/chemokines were upregulated in human SARS-CoV cases  .\n",

      "1168  The same group has shown that macrophages can also be infected by MERS-CoV and in this case infection with the virus induces the production of TNFα, IL-6, IFNγ and IL-12, thus initiating anti-viral responses  and additional evidence showed increased IFNλ, and several chemokines such as CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and IL-8 production from macrophages or dendritic cells, in the absence  or presence  of viral replication.\n",
      "1169  Our findings showed that the MERS-CoV S protein did not induce the production of TNFα and IL-6 but was rather capable of suppressing their induction by LPS.\n",
      "1170 The cytokines and chemokines IL-5, IL-6, KC , and G-CSF have higher abundances in the lungs of SARS-CoV MA15-infected wild-type mice than in C3 -/mice and are all known to promote neutrophil recruitment.\n",

      "1176  Removing the accessory genes 3-5 from a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV, which can cause clinical symptoms, prevented weight loss of the mice and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFα and CCL2, although the effect on IFN production was not described by the authors  .\n",
      "1177  This may partially explain the clinical observation of dramatic cytokine storm  and inflammation responses observed in SARS patients in the acute stage associated with lung lesions; it has been also suggested that the elevations of IL-6 and IL-8 due to SARS-CoV infection of the respiratory tract can induce the hyper-innate inflammatory response  .\n",

      "1376  T lymphocyte subsets showed a decrease in both CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cell subsets, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an early and reliable indicator for the development of severe COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can consume lymphocytes, which may also be an important reason for the virus to proliferate and spread in the early stage of the disease.\n",

      "1378  This may occur because the CD8 T cell response is preserved to a greater extent in IAV compared with SARS-CoV-infected middle-aged Pla2g2d +/+ mice, so that its augmentation has less of an effect on survival  .\n",
      "1379  To detect antigen-specific T cells after SARS-CoV infection, 1 × 10 6 cells were cultured in a 96-well round bottom plate in the presence of Brefeldin A and peptides corresponding to a CD8 T cell epitope  or a CD4 T cell epitope .\n",

      "1382  21 Using peptides in the four SARS-CoV structural proteins, an analysis of the memory T cell response in recovered SARS patients four years post-infection revealed that both CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells produced IFNc.\n",
      "1383  Moving forward, we cloned the a and b T cell receptor  chains of one immunodominant CTL epitope in the N protein  from the SARS-CoV specific CD8 1 T cells and used them to redirect the specificity of lymphocytes of healthy subjects lacking SARS-CoV specific memory T cells.\n",
